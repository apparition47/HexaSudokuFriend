Purpose: A 16x16 sudoku backtracking solver.

Platform: Created for iPhone 5 iOS 6.

How to use: There are 16 textfields representing each of the 16 lines of a sudoku grid. Input your sudoku grid line by line with space separation. Use 0s to represent empty cells and the numbers 1 to 16 to represent already filled in cells. All textfields are prefilled with a sample sudoku grid as a demonstration. Tap "solve" to start.

Known Issues: The solver stalls sometimes so a app restart may be necessary. Textfields may overlap on non-iPhone 5 devices.
